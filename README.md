It includes the following features:
* A game login interface;
* An introduction to the game rules;
* Multiple game modes:
** Single-player mode，
** Human vs. AI mode (implemented using a greedy algorithm for simple game-play)，
** Online multiplayer mode (limited to LAN connections)；
* and it also adds other simple functions for the requirements of the course CS109.

# Running the game

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cdlrayra/Jungle_Chess_CS109.git
```

Once the project is loaded, put the whole project code into the absolute Path:
```bash
C:\Users\Lenovo\IdeaProjects
```
Please run the login interface program file at:

* This marks the first programming language course (CS109) I undertook during my university studies, as well as my first programming project. This project not only represents a significant milestone in my programming journey but also stands as my first independently completed work. As the project was completed by a beginner, it inevitably contains various shortcomings. I kindly ask for your understanding and constructive feedback!
