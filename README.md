# Supplementary Note:
&bull 
&bull This marks the first programming language course (CS109) I undertook during my university studies, as well as my first programming project. This project not only represents a significant milestone in my programming journey but also stands as my first independently completed work. Here, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my TA! As the project was completed by a beginner, it inevitably contains various shortcomings. I kindly ask for your understanding and constructive feedback!
