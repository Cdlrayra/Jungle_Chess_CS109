# Jungle_Chess_CS109
This repository contains a Java-based project for the game "Jungle Chess".

It includes the following features:
A game login interface;
An introduction to the game rules;
Multiple game modes:
Single-player mode，
Human vs. AI mode (implemented using a greedy algorithm for simple game-play)，
Online multiplayer mode (limited to LAN connections)；
and it also adds other simple functions for the requirements of the course CS109.

# Supplementary Note:
This marks the first programming language course (CS109) I undertook during my university studies, as well as my inaugural programming project. Despite encountering numerous challenges throughout the development process—such as the limited coverage of graphical user interface programming in lectures，the missing of the teammate before the ddl and the specific implementation of the greedy algorithm used for human-computer gameplay—I benefited greatly from the dedicated guidance and support of the course TA. This project not only represents a significant milestone in my programming journey but also stands as my first independently completed work. Here, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my TA! As the project was completed by a beginner, it inevitably contains various shortcomings. I kindly ask for your understanding and constructive feedback!
（这是我大学期间学习的第一门编程语言课程（CS109），也是我完成的第一个编程项目。尽管在项目开发过程中遇到了诸多挑战，例如图形交互界面的编写并未在课堂中详细讲解，以及人机对弈使用的贪心算法的具体实现，但在此过程中，我也得到了课程TA的悉心指导（衷心感谢！）。这个项目不仅是我编程学习道路上的重要里程碑，也是我首次完成的完整作品。由于项目由初学者完成，难免存在诸多不足之处，恳请大家多多包涵与指教！）
